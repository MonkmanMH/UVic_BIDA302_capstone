# UVic_BIDA302_capstone

This repository houses the capstone projects for UVic BIDA302 (Data Analytics Coding Fundamentals)

The main course repo is https://github.com/MonkmanMH/UVic_BIDA302

## Project description

* A small project that will require the application of all of the concepts introduced

  - importing data
  
  - data wrangling—all the necessary data tidying and transformations
  
  - data modeling and summarization
  
  - communication (including tabular and plotting visualization)

* The project will be introduced in Week 4.

* Some projects will be available for you to choose from (listed below), but you may also bring your own data.

* To do this, you will have the end already defined: a summary table and/or a plot of some data that has been published.

* In the defined projects, you are to replicate a summary table and plot—you will have all the necessary data, and the end-goal. It's up to you to use your data analytics coding skills to create that summary table, plot.


## Project assessment

| **MARKS** | **OUTCOME** |
| --- | --- |
| 5 | data import, including defining the variable types |
| 10 | tidying and manipulation |
| 10 | visualization—tables and plots |
| 5 | going beyond—this might included adding an additional table, plot, or statistical model, or using functions so that your code isn't as WET |
