## Introduction

For this project, you will analyze trends in motor vehicle sales in Canada, by fuel type of the vehicle.

Statistics Canada publishes these data; they reported the release with some analysis here:
[New motor vehicle registrations, 2011 to 2018](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/191118/dq191118c-eng.htm)


Part of your project will create two tables: one is the Canadian totals, and it will look something like this (the multi-layer header is possible in R, but don't worry if you can't get it perfectly):

The second table will be an identical table, but with British Columbia numbers.


The second part is to create a plot or plots that demonstrate an interesting aspect of the data. This could be change over time, comparisons by fuel type, or comparisons of the Canadian total to British Columbia--or some other element you find in the data.
